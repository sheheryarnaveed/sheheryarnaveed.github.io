## **An enigma of a lost person.**

I am an HKU'22 and I desperately looking for CS-related opportunities because that's something I have utmost predilection towards.
_For the skills part you can view my_ <a href="http://www.sheheryarnaveed.com/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> _and my_ <a href="http://www.sheheryarnaveed.com/assets/docs/Resume-Muhammad%20Sheheryar%20Naveed.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>_.

_Now let me introduce to you about the turning point of my life that should be good enough to brief me as a person._

It was a huge mistake. Enormous! What have I done?
It all started a decade ago...

“Hey, chalky boy!” the nickname hurled at me took me by surprise. Laughter emanated from group of uber cool urbanites lounging around in their trendy school uniforms outside the school gate.  I shrank back thinking that perhaps my small town persona, evident in my carefully parted hair, starched uniform shirt and neat tie and above all my hesitant gait had given the game away. I was a denizen of Dera Ghazi Khan, a small Punjab town, who had been transplanted to the bustling metropolis of Rawalpindi for the sake of a better education. 

At the morning assembly I found myself singing anthem supposed to unite us, standing before a flag that supposedly represented an integrated student body, while feeling utterly alone. The light tone of my skin made me stand out like a sore thumb amongst my dusky peers, and I heard the odd giggle in the background, as those in the back row whispered “check out the new Pathan dude”. It dawned on me that my new schoolmates were laboring under the misapprehension that I was a Pashtun, an ethnic group distinct for their fair-skinned Caucasian appearance. In itself, the misapprehension meant little, but provincial stereotypes were notorious, and it appeared to be a popular sport amongst the Punjabi communities to caricature Pashtuns for their naiveté. The insinuations were painful, but I was more bothered by the fact that such well-educated individuals could sink so low. I may not have been a Pashtun, but I felt greatly empathetic to my compatriots that they had to put up with so much prejudice. I resolved to ignore the slurs and threw myself into academic life.

At the end of that year the Principal announced that I attained the highest GPA in my class with a distinction in Physics. Suddenly I was viewed with a new kind of respect. “Dude, are you really a Pashtun?”, one of my previous bullies queried, implying shock at the fact that someone of Pashtun extraction could outperform them. I shook my head “Not that it matters, but I am a Punjabi, like you”. His sheepish expression made up for it all. “Next time, don’t judge people and don’t stereotype”, I left the room with a parting shot, long in coming. It bothered me that such ethnic racism was alive and well at the grassroots level, even in schools and households.

 In Dera Ghazi Khan, such prejudice had not existed for due to its geographical location, people of different ethnicities existed in amity with one another. My grandfather, who had locally championed inter-community harmony and promoted diversity of ethnicity, religion and sect, inspired me change the status quo in my school and to prevent the ostracization of anyone who was considered different, like myself. To represent a town that lived in inter-faith harmony, I started “DGH,” the Dera Ghazi Khan Intercultural Harmony Club. It was fitting that my hometown should be the model of the true spirit of Pakistan’s unity. Through this club friends and I worked to promote harmony and goodwill among people of various cultures within the country and organized global villages to enhance ethnic inclusiveness and participate in interfaith activities. One day I spoke of my experience at the morning assembly, and my erstwhile detractors came up one by one to apologize afterwards. The color of skin and my accent had been overlooked because of my academic achievement. Encouragement from the school’s administration and its subsequent adoption of a novel ethos of inclusively won attention from local newspapers.

The desire to see lasting change after a year of racial discrimination guided me to work towards a more inclusive Pakistan. My own diverse cultural heritage helped me to build a platform which served as a collaborative hub for multi-cultural students in that effort. It is a wonderful change to hear my friends today praise my work for “our” country, rather than “their” province.
