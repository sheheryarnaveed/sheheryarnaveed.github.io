Built in February 2015, I made this website to distribute the notes, resources and tips I had collected in my O Level. Eventually, I added A Level and additional subjects.

I believe an online presence is necessary for any company or organization today. Hence, as the School Head Boy as well as a tech enthusiast, I am building my school's first ever website. In adddition to providing all kinds of information, the website will allow administration and faculty to use professional edu.pk emails for communication. Also, the website will be integrated with Google Apps for Education.
