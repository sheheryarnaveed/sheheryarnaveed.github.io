Piracy is a major problem for multinational software companies. They try hard, 
invest a lot and spend a big amount of time creating the perfect 
software/music/movie for the customers. And like every commercial company they 
set a price. Well, In return they do not get the profit they deserve. The 
reason for that is Piracy.

Some people known as pirates a.k.a hackers crack the software and make it 
available for free for millions of people around the world. Now, some do it 
for showing their prowess while others to gain personal benefits like 
recognition, money or fun. This is well received by the people because it is 
for free. They don't realise that the work they are illegally using was 
created through an investment. Imagine working hard throughout your life to 
make a quality product and not earning what you deserve. 

Companies have fought piracy face-to-face for several years but as is the case 
with a mob millions of people in the world can't be dealt with. So today they 
have devised other methods. 

Media companies have restricted features to just genuine discs. 

In the software field where piracy is the most damaging there have been very 
creative methods involved to counter piracy, most famous being technical 
support and warranty. Along with that, in recent years a new method has also 
been adopted by many major companies. They intentionally create online-only 
features that are accessible only if a person has the genuine software. 

A recent example is Microsoft Office 2013. That software franchise is the one 
of the most used in the world and therefore one of the most pirated. To 
counter that Microsoft has included cloud computing and online features. The 
aim is to tempt the people who use pirated softwares towards genuine software. 
This method also helps in verification of genuine softare. 

Another example is FIFA Franchise who since Fifa 09 has started including 
features to attract buyers into genuine software. First of all, EA Sports 
limited online features and superior graphics to consoles only (which can't be 
pirated until the owners decide to forgo the connectivity of device with the 
internet). They did it until Fifa 12. Now the online features are so much and 
so tempting for an avid football fan that he or she can't resist buying the 
game. 

Although genuine softwares are expensive they are of great quality. We should 
avoid piracy and we should recognise the hard work of developers.
