I strongly feel that without education a nation cannot prosper. This is 
evident by looking at those present and past civilizations who over a course 
of many decades have strived hard for education.  Some 600 Years ago the west 
was far behind several civilizations but today it is the most developed area 
on Earth. The west instead of a direction has become more of a proper noun 
today used to describe the USA and Europe.

I heard a quote somewhere, 

>The true purpose of education is to bring profoundness to one’s expression, 
broaden one’s perspective and build in the individuals, a better approach of 
looking at life.

The Islamic civilizations like the Prophet PBUH’s, Ummayad Caliphate and 
Abbasid Caliphate all were one of the most prosperous of their time. The 
reason is that they gave importance to education. Many minds of this 
civilization are attributed to be father of many modern-day subjects. The 
Greek, Roman, and Egyptian civilizations all are attributed to several of the 
greatest inventions of history. And isn't it a coincidence that they gave 
importance to education too. 

There is no surrogate for education and the premier aim of every nation should 
be education as it is the base and foundation of all development. 

Take example of the Mughal Empire of the Subcontinent. When it was at its peak 
and had immense wealth it used it for luxuries and expensive buildings. At the 
same the British invested in Education. India went on to become a heritage 
site while on the other hand Oxford University along with Cambridge and many 
others produced some of the greatest minds of the world and transformed the 
World Society for good. Their work is still used and praised and will always 
be, as knowledge does not decay. The Indian sites are just proving to be 
tourist attractions, nothing more than that. 

_The crux of my essay is:_  
Without Education a Nation cannot prosper. There is no surrogate for 
education and the premier aim of every nation should be education because it 
is the base and foundation of all development.
