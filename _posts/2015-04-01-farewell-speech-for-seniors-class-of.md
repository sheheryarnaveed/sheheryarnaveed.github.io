_Respected Principal, Vice Principal, Heads, Teachers and Dear Friends,_

Good Evening! First of all, I am humbled and honoured to speak on the behalf of my class. 

I would like to start with a question, "Is Time Travel Possible?" 
What do you think? Is it possible to travel through time?

Well I think, Yes it is. In fact we all are travelling through time right now. We are on a journey through time and it's called Life. On this journey through time, with every tick of the clock we experience new moments. The people we meet on the way, the friends we make, the places we see, the beauty we appreciate are all moments in our lives and they define us, they make us who we are. Like a clock, our life is a journey through time but the way it’s different is that it will never come around. We will never experience the same moments again but we can rejoice in remembering them. We can celebrate and be proud of the moments in our lives.

For us, the Connection with the Class of 2015 has been one such moment of our lives. We are proud to have known this group of wonderful people for the past 14 Years of our school life. It was only yesterday when we were recapping our memories that we realized that time has passed by so fast. 14 Years is not a short time and only the wonderful can make it seem to pass by without people ever realizing it.

The Class of 2015 is a group of eight diversely talented people. Maths, Charms, Fun, Sports, Cupcakes, Jokes, they know it all and they truly personify the true meaning of “Class”. 
The Class of 2015 really has a “Class” of its own.

Today, It is indeed both, a sad and joyful moment as we are gathered here today in the spirit of friendship and love. It is sad because we will lose close friends and inspiring seniors that have been with us for over fourteen years. On the other hand, it is a joy to see such amazing people advance further into their lives.

Every beginning has an end. And every end is a new beginning. A Year Ends; giving rise to the start of another. It's a relentless cycle seen in every aspect of our lives. And we hope that as this phase of life for the Class of 2015 ends, a new and better phase starts.

The important thing is not to be bitter over life's disappointments. Learn to let go of the past, and recognize that every day won't be sunny. And when you find yourself lost in the darkness of despair remember, it's only in the black of night that you see the stars, and those stars lead you back home. 

Don't be afraid to make mistakes, to stumble and fall, because most of the time the greatest rewards come from doing the things that scare you the most. Maybe you'll get everything you wish for. Maybe you'll get more than you ever could have imagined. Who knows where life will take you. The road is long and in the end, the journey is the destination. We wish you the best of Luck and May Allah bless you with a Happy & Faithful Life.
